# Stack Exercises | Protostar

## Overview
This folder contains my stack excercise solutions for Protostar:
https://exploit-exercises.lains.space/protostar/stack0/

## Excercise overviews
Source code is in each .py file.

### Stack0
This level introduces the concept that memory can be accessed outside of its allocated region, how the stack variables are laid out, and that modifying outside of the allocated memory can modify program execution.

### Stack1
This level looks at the concept of modifying variables to specific values in the program, and how the variables are laid out in memory.

### Stack2
Stack2 looks at environment variables, and how they can be set.

### Stack3
Stack3 looks at environment variables, and how they can be set, and overwriting function pointers stored on the stack (as a prelude to overwriting the saved EIP)

### Stack4
Stack4 takes a look at overwriting saved EIP and standard buffer overflows.

### Stack5
Stack5 is a standard buffer overflow, this time introducing shellcode.

### Stack6
Stack6 looks at what happens when you have restrictions on the return address. This level can be done in a couple of ways, such as finding the duplicate of the payload ( objdump -s will help with this), or ret2libc , or even return orientated programming. It is strongly suggested you experiment with multiple ways of getting your code to execute here.

### Stack7
Stack6 introduces return to .text to gain code execution. The metasploit tool “msfelfscan” can make searching for suitable instructions very easy, otherwise looking through objdump output will suffice.
